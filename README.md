This is a demo of one of the projects I developed

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
This project was created for a degree project, where the client gave me the designs and I implemented them with the technology of my choice.
I used Next.JS because React.js is integrated into the framework, with high possibilities of continuing with the development of all the logic as well.

## If you want to see it:
Precondition:
You need to have installed node.js.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Second, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
